# Golang Challenges
The best way to learn coding is by coding.

That's why sites like [FreeCodeCamp](https://FreeCodeCamp.com) and [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/dashboard) exist.

## PROBLEM
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of resources for beginners to tackle challenges in Golang. Even a site like CodeWars does not support Golang at the time of this writing.

## SOLUTION
This project aims to contribute a set of open-source challenges ranging in difficulty from `basic` to `advanced`.
