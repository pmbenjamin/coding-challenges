# Golang Challenges
The best way to learn is by actually doing something.

That's why we have sites like [FreeCodeCamp](https://FreeCodeCamp.com) and [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/dashboard) that encourage challengers to tackle problems and build upon their knowledge.

## PROBLEM
Unfortunately, there are not a lot of resources for beginners to tackle challenges in Golang. Even a site like CodeWars doesn't have any challenges for Golang.

## SOLUTION
This project aims to correct this by copying FreeCodeCamp's style of `basic`, `intermediate`, and `advanced` challenges. I aim to go through these challenges and consolidate the answers in a solutions directory.
